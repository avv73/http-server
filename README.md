# http-server
A simple HTTP server I coded as an homework assignment during the Softuni C# Advanced course. The server is capable to respond to HTTP requests and 
handle invalid requests, using the server directory as a simple website source. There is a lot room for improvement here, so I will be updating it sometime
in the future.
